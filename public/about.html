<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Caroline and I'm currently a rising sophomore at McGill University pursuing a undergraduate degree in mathematics and computer science. I love listening to music; you'd often catch me with headphones. I also have a big passion for solving puzzles which includes chess problems. </p>

<p>As for the summer of 2024, I'm actively looking for internships that are full-stack developpers, back-end developpers and quantitave roles.</p>

<p>Feel free to stick as my website records my coding journey. I will be posting a few projects in the near future.</p>
