<p>Great movie to watch for fun.</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>Didn't understand much of the movie as there were too many unknown scientific terms especially when the actors were discussing about the physics theories. Props to the actors for memorizing so many technical terms.</p>

<p>Very frustrating to watch. Traditional plot where it's the brother that cleans up his little brother's mess, but he ends up dying near the end of the movie.</p>
